This latter point was discussed with Dr. Nathalie Costedoat-Chalumeau, who has published extensively on measurement of HCQ. While it might be optimal for the mothers anticipating enrollment in the study to all have been on HCQ prior to conception, this is impractical. Some may never achieve pregnancy and not want to take HCQ unless they conceive (especially those asymptomatic). On the other hand, women with SLE are likely to already be on HCQ and it would limit enrollment to exclude these patients if all must initiate HCQ only at enrollment in the first trimester. Although the accepted dogma is that HCQ requires several months for maximal efficacy in treating rheumatic disease, it is unknown whether this would apply to transplacental passage or fetal levels (which are impossible to measure). Dr. Costedoat-Chalumeau suggests that HCQ is probably a three compartment model which includes the circulation, tissues and cells. In the circulation, the half life is approximately 7 days and in the tissues, it is 40 days. In Dr. Costedoat-Chalumeau's experience, steady state blood levels of HCQ are achieved in 4-6 weeks. Thus, dosing the mother no later than 10 weeks gestation should provide sufficient fetal exposure before the vulnerable period of CHB which is generally accepted to span 18-24 wks. Furthermore, the placenta has to be formed for HCQ to gain access to the fetus and it may be effective quickly for the biology we are considering"
